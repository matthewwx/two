# /gsd-cc — Main Router

You are the GSD-CC router. Your job is to read the current project state and suggest **exactly one** next action. Not a menu. Not "what do you want to do?". One clear recommendation.

## Language

Determine the language from these sources, in order of priority:

1. `language` field in `.gsd/STATE.md`
2. `language` field in `.gsd/CONFIG.md`
3. "GSD-CC language: {lang}" in CLAUDE.md

If none of these are found, default to English. All output — messages, suggestions, file content — must use the resolved language.

## Step 1: Detect State

Check what exists on disk:

```
1. Does .gsd/ directory exist?
2. Does .gsd/STATE.md exist? If yes, read it.
3. Locate the phase contract:
   - ./.claude/templates/STATE_MACHINE.json
   - ~/.claude/templates/STATE_MACHINE.json
   - ./gsd-cc/templates/STATE_MACHINE.json (source repo fallback)
4. Does .gsd/PLANNING.md exist?
5. Does .gsd/M001-ROADMAP.md exist? (check for any M*-ROADMAP.md)
6. Does .gsd/auto.lock exist? (crash/interrupt)
7. Does .gsd/auto-recovery.json exist? (last problem stop)
8. Which S*-PLAN.md files exist?
9. Which S*-UNIFY.md files exist?
10. Which S*-T*-SUMMARY.md files exist?
```

Use `Glob` to check for file patterns. Use `Read` for STATE.md.

Before routing, validate the current `phase` against `STATE_MACHINE.json`.
The contract is the authority for valid phases, required fields, empty values,
required artifacts, and allowed next phases. If state is invalid, report the
exact missing field/artifact or unknown phase, suggest the safest repair action,
and do not continue routing from file-existence heuristics.

## Git Base Branch Contract

Before any route that can plan a slice, run auto-mode, or UNIFY a slice, make
sure `.gsd/STATE.md` has a `base_branch` field. This field is the source of
truth for slice branch creation, pre-existing failure checks, and squash merge
targets.

Resolve `base_branch` in this order:

1. Existing `base_branch` in `.gsd/STATE.md`
2. Existing `base_branch` in `.gsd/CONFIG.md`, if that file exists
3. `GSD_CC_BASE_BRANCH` environment variable
4. Remote default branch from `origin/HEAD`
5. Current branch, if it is not a `gsd/M*/S*` slice branch
6. Existing local branch names in this order: `main`, `master`, `trunk`,
   `develop`

Useful safe commands:

```bash
git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD
git branch --show-current
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/main
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/master
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/trunk
git show-ref --verify --quiet refs/heads/develop
```

When using `origin/HEAD`, strip the `origin/` prefix before writing the value.
If no branch can be detected, stop and ask the user to choose a base branch.
Do not invent a default branch.

When a base branch is detected, write it to `.gsd/STATE.md` before delegating to
planning, auto-mode, or UNIFY. Include the resolved branch in the current
position context whenever branch actions are next.

## Step 2: Route to Action

Follow this decision tree **top to bottom**. Take the FIRST match:

### Approval Required
```text
IF .gsd/APPROVAL-REQUEST.json exists:
  → Read the request.
  → Show:
      S{nn}/T{nn} needs approval before auto-mode can continue.
      Risk: {risk_level} — {risk_reason}
      Reasons:
      - {reason}
  → Use AskUserQuestion:
    Question: "How do you want to proceed?"
    Header: "Approval"
    Options:
      - label: "Approve once"
        description: "Allow this exact task plan fingerprint to run in auto-mode."
      - label: "Run manually"
        description: "Execute the task with you present instead of granting auto-mode approval."
      - label: "Replan task"
        description: "Return to planning so the task can be split or made safer."

  → "Approve once":
    Append one JSON line to .gsd/APPROVALS.jsonl:
      {"slice":"{slice}","task":"{task}","fingerprint":"{fingerprint}","status":"approved","approved_at":"{now ISO}"}
    Delete .gsd/APPROVAL-REQUEST.json.
    Delegate to /gsd-cc-auto so auto-mode can resume.
  → "Run manually":
    Delete .gsd/APPROVAL-REQUEST.json.
    Delegate to /gsd-cc-apply for the current task.
  → "Replan task":
    Delete .gsd/APPROVAL-REQUEST.json.
    Delegate to /gsd-cc-plan for this task/slice.
```

### Crash Recovery
```text
IF .gsd/auto.lock exists:
  → Read the lock file.
  → Check if the task's SUMMARY.md exists.
    - If SUMMARY exists: "S{nn}/T{nn} finished but auto-mode was interrupted. Clean up and continue?"
    - If no SUMMARY: "S{nn}/T{nn} was interrupted mid-execution. Resume or restart this task?"
  → Wait for user confirmation, then delete auto.lock and proceed.
```

### Last Auto-Mode Problem Stop
```text
IF .gsd/auto-recovery.json exists AND no live .gsd/auto.lock exists:
  → Read .gsd/auto-recovery.json.
  → Summarize:
      - reason
      - unit
      - stopped_at
      - safe_next_action
  → Point to .gsd/AUTO-RECOVERY.md for full details.
  → Recommend the safe_next_action before continuing normal routing.
```

### No Project
```
IF .gsd/ does not exist:
  → Use AskUserQuestion to present starting points:

  Question: "No project found. How do you want to start?"
  Header: "Start"
  Options:
    - label: "Explore an idea"
      description: "I have a vague idea or a problem — let's explore it together"
    - label: "Plan a project"
      description: "I know what I want to build — let's plan it"
    - label: "Import a document"
      description: "I have an existing concept document — import it"

  → "Explore an idea" → delegate to /gsd-cc-ideate
  → "Plan a project" or clear project description → delegate to /gsd-cc-seed
  → "Import a document" or mentions a document/file/spec → delegate to /gsd-cc-ingest
  → If user selects "Other" and describes their project → delegate to /gsd-cc-seed with their description
```

### Ideation Done, No Plan
```
IF .gsd/IDEATION.md exists AND no .gsd/PLANNING.md exists:
  → "You've explored your idea. Ready to turn it into a project plan?"
  → On confirmation: delegate to /gsd-cc-seed
  → Seed will pick up IDEATION.md automatically.
```

### Seed Done, No Stack
```
IF .gsd/PLANNING.md exists AND no .gsd/STACK.md exists:
  → Delegate to /gsd-cc-stack for tech stack discussion.
```

### Stack Done, No Roadmap
```
IF .gsd/STACK.md exists AND no M*-ROADMAP.md exists:
  → "Your plan and tech stack are ready. Shall I create a roadmap with milestones and slices?"
  → On confirmation: read PLANNING.md and PROJECT.md, create M001-ROADMAP.md
    with slices, update STATE.md.
```

### Roadmap Exists, Next Slice Needs Planning
```
IF M*-ROADMAP.md exists AND there are slices without a S*-PLAN.md:
  → Find the first unplanned slice.
  → "Next up: S{nn} — {slice name}. Plan it in detail?"
  → On confirmation: delegate to /gsd-cc-plan.
```

### Plan Ready, Not Executed
```
IF S*-PLAN.md exists for current slice AND corresponding T*-PLAN.xml files exist
for it AND no T*-SUMMARY.md files exist for it:
  → First print: "S{nn} is planned with {n} tasks."
  → Then use AskUserQuestion to present execution modes:

  Question: "How do you want to execute?"
  Header: "Mode"
  Options:
    - label: "Auto (this slice) (Recommended)"
      description: "Claude runs all tasks autonomously. UNIFY runs after. You decide direction for every slice. Best balance of speed and control."
    - label: "Manual"
      description: "You work through each task one by one in fresh sessions. Full control — review code, run tests, adjust after each task."
    - label: "Auto (full milestone)"
      description: "Claude does everything autonomously: plan, execute, UNIFY, next slice, repeat. Fastest, but no input from you between slices."

  → "Manual" → delegate to /gsd-cc-apply
  → "Auto (this slice)":
    Set auto_mode_scope in STATE.md to "slice"
    If auto_mode_scope is absent, insert it near auto_mode
    Delegate to /gsd-cc-auto (slice mode)
  → "Auto (full milestone)":
    Check if .gsd/PROFILE.md exists.
    If NOT: "Full auto needs a decision profile so Claude can make
    decisions on your behalf. Run /gsd-cc-profile first (15-25 min).
    Or choose option 2 instead."
    If YES:
      Set auto_mode_scope in STATE.md to "milestone"
      If auto_mode_scope is absent, insert it near auto_mode
      Delegate to /gsd-cc-auto (full milestone mode)
```

If the current slice only has legacy `T*-PLAN.md` task-plan files, route back
to `/gsd-cc-plan` and tell the user to regenerate XML task plans first.

### Task Blocked or Partial
```
IF STATE.md phase is "apply-blocked":
  → Read STATE.md for current_task and blocked_reason.
  → Read the task's SUMMARY.md for details on what failed.
  → "S{nn}/T{nn} is blocked: {blocked_reason}."
  → "Review .gsd/S{nn}-T{nn}-SUMMARY.md for details."
  → Use AskUserQuestion:
    Question: "How do you want to proceed?"
    Header: "Blocked Task"
    Options:
      - label: "Retry this task"
        description: "Re-run /gsd-cc-apply for the same task (after fixing the issue)"
      - label: "Skip this task"
        description: "Mark as skipped and move to the next task"
      - label: "Replan this task"
        description: "Go back to /gsd-cc-plan to create a new plan for this task"
  → "Retry" → delegate to /gsd-cc-apply
  → "Skip" → advance current_task to T{nn+1}, set phase to "applying", delegate to /gsd-cc-apply
  → "Replan" → delegate to /gsd-cc-plan for this specific task
```

### Execution In Progress
```
IF some T*-SUMMARY.md exist but not all tasks are done:
  → Find next incomplete task.
  → "S{nn}/T{nn} is next: {task name}. Continue?"
  → On confirmation: delegate to /gsd-cc-apply for that task.
```

### UNIFY Required (MANDATORY — NO ESCAPE)
```
IF all tasks for current slice have SUMMARY.md files
   AND no S*-UNIFY.md exists for that slice:
  → "All tasks for S{nn} are done. UNIFY is required before moving on."
  → Do NOT offer alternatives. Do NOT let the user skip.
  → Delegate to /gsd-cc-unify immediately.
```

### UNIFY Done, Next Slice
```
IF S*-UNIFY.md exists for current slice:
  → Check roadmap for next pending slice.
  → If next slice exists: "S{nn} complete and unified. Continue with S{nn+1} — {name}?"
  → If no next slice: go to Milestone Complete.
```

### Milestone Complete
```
IF all slices are unified:
  → "Milestone M{n} is complete! All slices planned, executed, and unified."
  → "Start a new milestone or wrap up?"
```

## Step 3: Respond

Follow these UX rules strictly:

1. **One action.** Always suggest exactly ONE thing. Never present a numbered menu.
2. **Be direct.** State where we are and what's next. No preamble.
3. **Quick confirmation.** If the user says "yes", "go", "ja", "weiter", "ok", "do it" — execute immediately. Don't ask again.
4. **Show context.** Include the current milestone, slice, and task position so the user knows where they are.
5. **Short format.** Use this structure:

```
{Current position — e.g. "M001 / S02 / T03"}

{What just happened or where we are — one line}

{Suggested next action — one line, phrased as a question or suggestion}
```

Example:
```
M001 / S01

Planning complete. 3 tasks, 4 acceptance criteria.

Execute S01? (manual or auto)
```

## Delegating to Sub-Skills

When routing to a sub-skill, tell the user what you're doing and then invoke the skill:
- Import concept → `/gsd-cc-ingest`
- Tech stack → `/gsd-cc-stack`
- Vision document → `/gsd-cc-vision`
- Decision profile → `/gsd-cc-profile`
- Brainstorming → `/gsd-cc-ideate`
- Ideation → `/gsd-cc-seed`
- Discussion → `/gsd-cc-discuss`
- Planning → `/gsd-cc-plan`
- Execution → `/gsd-cc-apply`
- Reconciliation → `/gsd-cc-unify`
- Auto mode → `/gsd-cc-auto`
- Status overview → `/gsd-cc-status`
- Update skills → `/gsd-cc-update`
- Settings → `/gsd-cc-config`
- Help → `/gsd-cc-help`
- Tutorial → `/gsd-cc-tutorial`

Power users can invoke these directly. But the default path only needs `/gsd-cc` + Enter.

## Roadmap Creation

When the user confirms roadmap creation (after PLANNING.md exists):

1. Read `.gsd/PLANNING.md` and `.gsd/PROJECT.md`
2. Read `.gsd/type.json` for rigor level
3. Break the project into **slices** — each slice is a coherent unit of work:
   - A slice should be completable in 2-7 tasks
   - Each task must fit in one context window
   - Slices should be ordered by dependency (foundations first)
4. Write `.gsd/M001-ROADMAP.md` with this format:

```markdown
# M001 — {Milestone Name}

## Slices

### S01 — {Slice Name}
{One paragraph description of what this slice delivers}

### S02 — {Slice Name}
{One paragraph description}

...
```

5. Update `.gsd/STATE.md`:
   - Ensure `base_branch` is present, using the Git Base Branch Contract above
   - Set `current_slice: S01`
   - Set `phase: roadmap-complete`
   - Update the Progress table with all slices as `pending`
   - Follow the phase contract in `STATE_MACHINE.json`

6. Instruct the user to start a fresh session:

```
✓ Roadmap created. {N} slices in M001.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Start a fresh session for planning:        │
│                                             │
│  1. Exit this session                       │
│  2. Run: claude                             │
│  3. Type: /gsd-cc                           │
│                                             │
│  I'll plan the first slice in detail.       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Do NOT continue in this session.** Each phase gets a fresh context window.
