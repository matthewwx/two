# /gsd-cc-config — Settings

You manage GSD-CC configuration stored in CLAUDE.md.

## Language

Check for "GSD-CC language: {lang}" in CLAUDE.md (loaded automatically).
All output must use that UI language. If not found, default to English.
Commit messages are controlled separately by "GSD-CC commit language: {lang}"
and default to English.

## Step 1: Show Current Settings

Read the CLAUDE.md file (project-level first, then global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
Look first for the managed marker block:

```markdown
<!-- gsd-cc:config:start -->
# GSD-CC Config
GSD-CC language: {language}
GSD-CC commit language: {commit_language}
<!-- gsd-cc:config:end -->
```

If no marker block exists, read the legacy unmarked `# GSD-CC Config` section.
Missing language values default to English.

Show:
```text
GSD-CC Settings

  Language:         {current UI language or "English (default)"}
  Commit language:  {current commit language or "English (default)"}
  Config:           {which CLAUDE.md file — project or global}

What would you like to change?
  1) Language
  2) Commit language
```

## Step 2: Change Language

If the user wants to change the language:

1. Ask: "Which language? (e.g. English, Deutsch, Français, Español, ...)"
2. Update CLAUDE.md:
   - Always write the managed marker block shown above.
   - Replace `GSD-CC language:` with the requested language.
   - Preserve any existing `GSD-CC commit language:` value, or use English if
     it is missing.
   - If only a legacy unmarked config section exists, replace it with the
     managed marker block.
   - If no config section exists, append the managed marker block at the end:
    ```markdown
    <!-- gsd-cc:config:start -->
     # GSD-CC Config
     GSD-CC language: {language}
     GSD-CC commit language: English
     <!-- gsd-cc:config:end -->
     ```
3. Confirm: "Language changed to {language}. Takes effect immediately."

## Step 3: Change Commit Language

If the user wants to change the commit language:

1. Ask: "Which commit language? (default: English)"
2. Update CLAUDE.md:
   - Always write the managed marker block shown above.
   - Replace or add `GSD-CC commit language: {language}`.
   - Preserve any existing `GSD-CC language:` value, or use English if it is
     missing.
   - If only a legacy unmarked config section exists, replace it with the
     managed marker block.
   - If no config section exists, append the managed marker block with
     `GSD-CC language: English` and the requested commit language.
3. Confirm: "Commit language changed to {language}. UI language unchanged."

## Where to Write

- If a project-level `CLAUDE.md` exists (in current working directory), update that one
- Otherwise update `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global)
- If the user wants to change scope (project vs global), ask which one

## Safety

- **Never delete existing CLAUDE.md content.** Only add or modify the GSD-CC Config section.
- **Preserve all other content** in CLAUDE.md — it may contain important project instructions.
